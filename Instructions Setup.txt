Step 1
INSTALLING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES FOR THE ARDUINO IDE.

"The EmonLib, LCD and Wire.h Libraries are required on the Arduino IDE for this project".

-From the Arduino IDE Home Page, Navigate to Sketch, Include Library, and then Manage Libraries.
- Search for EmonLib and click install.
-Navigate to sketch again, Click on "Include Library" and then "Add .zip Library".
- Select the "LCD Library" in the "Library" folder in this document.
- Repeat the above process for the "Wire.h Library"

==========================================================================================

Step 2
UPLOADING THE CODE TO THE MICROCONTROLLER

- In this folder, Navigate to "SmartPressingIron.ino" from  the "SmartPressingIron Folder"
- Connect the Arduino Uno to your Computer, Launch the "SmartPressingIron.ino" file and upload the code 
to the Arduino Uno Microcontroller.


==========================================================================================


Step 3
SETTING UP AND CONNECTING YOUR CIRCUIT TO THE PRESSING IRON

-The "ZMPT 101b" voltage sensor will be connected to the pressing iron via extra cables,
 which will be connected as shown in the "ZMPT_Voltage Sensor" diagram in the photos folder.
-  The Voltage Sensor will also be connected to the Arduino Uno Microcontroller circuit as shown 
  in the "ZMPT_Voltage Sensor" pinout diagram in the photos folder.
- As for the Current sensor, It is the "SCT_Current Sensor" image in the photos folder.
- The silver end of the black cable will be cut and the two balck and red cables will then be 
  connected to resisitors and to the Arduino Uno Microcontroller as shown in the "SCT_Current Sensor_Circuit.jpeg"
   pinout diagram.


==========================================================================================

Step 4
SETTING UP THE WI-FI MODULE

- The Arduino Uno should be connected to the Wi-Fi Module to enable connection and data transfer over the internet.
-  The Pinout diagram named "Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)" should be followed in the connection to the Arduino Uno.


==========================================================================================


Step 5
SETTING UP THE INTERNET CONNECTION

- In Order to send data over the internet, A Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot should be switched on, and the "mySSID"
  string in the code (Line 15) should be replaced with the SSID of the Wi-Fi Hotspot.
-  As for the password also, one should replace the "myPWD" string on (Line 16) of the code with the 
  Password of the Mobile hotspot.


==========================================================================================

Step 6.
CROSS-CHECKING AND SENDING THE DATA READINGS TO THE CLOUD (THINGSPEAK)

- The various pinout diagrams should be cross checked and then the Mobile hotspot should be 
  switched on.
- The User should Sign Up to Thingspeak.com and create an account.
-  After this, the user should click on "Create a channel".
- After creating a channel, the user should click on "API Keys".
- The user should then copy this API Key, and replace it with the "myAPI" string on (Line 17) of the Source code
- If all the connections are correct, The Readings from the arduino Uno should display
